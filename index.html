        <h1>South Africa 2015</h1>
        
        <p>In 2015 I visited South Africa. My husband was born there and still has family there so we've been lucky enough to visit a few times.
            On this occasion we took my parents, as it's been on their bucket list for a while.
        </p>

        <p>We spent 3 weeks travelling to various places, concentrating on national parks and family visits. </p>
